### Spamton Enter Holder
This is a program for letting you easier fight Spamton in Deltarune. For context there is a bug in Deltarune that lets you shoot fully loaded bullets upon using Enter and C at the same time (This is not really a bug, as the game makes spamton angry at you if you use it, this will probaly have effects later on if you do it)

To use activate/deactivate it press right shift, to exit the python program press esc, an audio queue will play

The program holds the Enter keys so that you do not have to do, use C to navigate menus/shoot bullets, pressing enter will cause chaos

### Installation
```bash
pip install keyboard
```
