### Spamton Enter Holder
This is a program for letting you easier fight Spamton in Deltarune. For context there is a bug in Deltarune that lets you shoot fully loaded bullets upon using Enter and C at the same time. (This is not really a bug, more like a feature as spamton gets angry at you if you use the bug.)

To activate/deactivate the program press right shift, an audio queue will play upon activation/deactivation, to exit the program use esc or crtl c.

The program holds the Enter keys so that you do not have to do, use C to navigate menus/shoot bullets, pressing enter will cause chaos (always fully loaded bullets).

### Installation
```bash
pip install keyboard
```

### Usage

python .\main.py
